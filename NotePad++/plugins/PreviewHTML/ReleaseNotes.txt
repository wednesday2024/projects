         By default, the plugin waits for 1000 ms (= 1 second), but this can be adjusted by 
         creating a settings file "$(PLUGINSCONFIG)\PreviewHTML\Settings.ini", and adding the 
         following lines to it, replacing 1000 by the number of milliseconds you want it to wait.
         If you want to disable the autorefresh, specify an interval of 0 ms.
         
         [Autorefresh]
         Interval=1000
