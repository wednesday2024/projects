BEWARE SPOILERS!
****************

Jacob and Del met in vet school. He was a recently graduated tutor, and she was training to be a vet nurse. Whilst they were immediately attracted to each other, they maintained a professional relationship until she graduated, after which he invited her out for a celebratory drink.
Less than a year later they were married.
He took a job in Gotoro and loved it there. Eloise was born a few years later.
Then Del became ill.

The Gotoran attitude towards Ferngillians was becoming increasingly hostile, and rather than seek treatment in Gotoro, they took their 3 year old daughter and returned to Ferngill.
Del became worse, and eventually died.
Eloise was six.

Jacob kept contact with one of Del's close friends there, Hanna, and as she grew older, Eloise insisted on sending letters to her son, Sora. The two were almost the same age, being born days apart.

They'd played together as toddlers, but of course Eloise couldn't remember that.

Jacob got work in the Stardew Valley area, tending to hoofstock and also turning his hand to wildlife rehabilitation. His letters to Hanna became fewer and farther between, but Eloise still insisted on writing to Sora every week.

When the mail service between continents collapsed, he started to resort to passing letters through the local smuggler.He suspects that sometimes she brings out more than just wares.


************************************
Now, Clint and Jacob as brothers... 
************************************

Jacob was always the smartest, the better looking. He was always shy, but in a polite way that tended to endear people to him. 
His younger brother, Clint, was also shy. But in a far less endearing manner. He would sulk. It was always "poor me" and he acted as though he were the one wronged.
The two siblings did not get on.
Their father was a no-nonsense, hardworking blacksmith. He wanted his sons to be manly from the start, and whilst Jacob escaped the majority of his disdain by getting good grades and insisting that he was going to become a doctor (he always wanted to be an animal doctor, but didn't dare admit _that_), Clint was a real "Mommy's boy". Soft, his father described him.
He was never beaten, nor physically abused in any way, but the emotional damage was true... His father just didn't love him.
Then there was the accident in the mines.
their father lost most of his clientele, and his business fell apart. They divorced.
Their mother moved to Zuzu City, and Clint was basically bullied into staying with his father, to continue in the "family business".
He didn't want to, but he didn't have any other prospects, and it was easier not to argue. So he stayed.
Pelican Town began to fall apart.
Jacob went on to pursue his dreams at university. Then took up a post as far from his dysfunctional family as possible: in Gotoro.
Their father became depressed, started spending more and more time away from home, and one day vanished.
Rumor had it he ran away with a woman, others thought he'd gone off into the wilderness (or maybe the caves) and died alone.
Clint took over the blacksmith trade. 

Clint and Jacob are estranged. Even when Jacob moved back to Pelican Town, taking over the old stone house, they never really connected.
There was too much bad blood between them.
Clint, angry that his brother hadn't helped him more, or stood up for him.
Jacob, pushed away by his brother's sarcasm and self-pity.

*********************
Jacob's heart events:
*********************

2-heart event:
Eloise drags you into the barn, here Jacob is tending to an injured animal. He is at first shy, but Eloise basically badgers him into answer questions. He needs the farmer's help - perhaps to hold the animal? Eloise is too small and it's potentially dangerous.
Maybe a cow? Or possibly an alpaca? Eloise makes some comment that she wishes her uncle could've helped, but he distracts her mid-sentence, clearly not wanting to talk about personal matters with the farmer.
After this scene you are granted access to the barn.
(Maybe it could sometimes spawn wool?)

4-heart mini-event (4 hearts Jacob and Clint):
Jacob and Clint run into each other in town. An argument ensues. What are they arguing about? Why are they arguing? Jacob isn't the argumentative sort... maybe he's tried to approach Clint and Clint's pushing him away?

4-heart event:
Jacob is distraught. He is due to head into the mountains to collect some released chickens, and the person who was supposed to be assisting him has not turned up. If the chickens arenï¿½t captured today, theyï¿½re going to be killed, but heï¿½s not sure he can catch dozens of chickens alone.
Farmer can offer to help.
If yes, both jump in the truck, it fades to black (bus noises?) and farmer finds themselves in the Deep Mountains. There are a lot of chickens. How much to show in the capturing scene? Itï¿½s a pity farmer canï¿½t be given a chicken. 

6-heart event:
Farmer finds Jacob standing by his wife's grave. He tells farmer about Del, and about life in the Gotoro Republic. He expresses his concerns about bringing up his daughter without a mother figure. 
Farmer can reassure him (or not).
This one needs to be a little more interesting.... Maybe Jacob is telling Eloise a goodnight story, something about her mother, and runs into farmer as he's leaving her to sleep. He then confides in farmer about his worries.
- You're doing a fine job!
- It would be better for her to have a woman in her life.
- Have you considered remarrying?

8-heart event
Some sort of culmination of events? A family tragedy means he has to approach Clint - maybe their mother is ill. He really wants Clint to reconcile and seeks farmer's help. Farmer can aid or inhibit. (this awkwardly is not even slightly compatible with Clarice, except that she too is estranged from her mother, but for entirely understandable reasons).

10-heart event
Reconiliation between the two siblings. Eloise is stoked. She immediately wants her Uncle to help her make all manner of cool things.

**********************
Eloise's heart events:
**********************

2-heart event
The duck arrives.

4-heart event:
Eloise talks about Sora

6-heart event:
Another duck one?

8-heart event part one:
Something relating to Sora and the war in Gotoro?
Eloise is crying. She hasnï¿½t received a letter from Sora in weeks, and the last time she heard from him, he and his mother had been hiding in a basement and she saw on the news that the city he was in has been bombed. Sheï¿½s really worried something terrible might have happened to him.
Farmer can comfort her, or give her the cold harsh truth.

8-heart event part two: (about 14 days later)
Eloise greets the player all happy smiles. Sora is safe! He and his mother and baby sister had to escape the city through the sewers, but they did, and now theyï¿½re in the countryside, far away from danger, in a little valley like Stardew Valley. Theyï¿½re growing their own food and everything.

10-heart event
Eloise decides to match-make farmer up with her Dad. It starts with a letter sent through the mail (somehow indicate that it is not Jacobï¿½s writing, maybe excessive !! marks).

ï¿½Hi farmer @!
I just wanted to write and say that I really like you lots, and you should come over for dinner tomorrow night! What do you think? Dinner is at 6!^
I really really home youï¿½ll come!^ With love,^Jacob XXOO.ï¿½
%% conversationTopic JacobDate 1%% [#]Letter from Jacob??ï¿½

If either is talked to within the day, Eloise will badger farmer about how much she hopes theyï¿½ll come. Jacob will be friendly but not unusually so.

Scene starts with Eloise fussing over her Dad and him being very perplexed. Why is she asking him about what heï¿½s wearing? Sure, heï¿½s invited farmer over for dinner, but thatï¿½s because theyï¿½re good friends. Nothing else.
Farmer knocks on the door, Eloise bounces over to answer it.
ï¿½Dadï¿½s ever so happy youï¿½re coming for dinner! Heï¿½s a really good cook, you know.ï¿½

********************
Eloise and Leo 
********************
Eloise likes Leo, but is worried that he thinks she's too chatty, and that he likes Jas better. Perhaps she overheard his comment to the farmer (imply it).
So she decides to ask the farmer for advice 
Farmer can suggest:
- I'm sure he likes you just fine, but perhaps you could try listening more.
- You talk far too much and ask too many questions. It's no wonder he doesn't like you!
First option: Eloise accepts your judgment and vows to try and talk less and listen more.
Second option: Eloise gets upset, loses -250 friendship and runs away. Also vowing to talk less.

Leo, who is used to her chatter, thinks she's mad at him, and comes to the farmer for advice.
Farmer can suggest:
- She really likes you, but she's trying to be more like Jas.
- She thinks you're weird.
First Option: Leo is relieved and confronts Eloise, reassuring her that he likes her the way she is and he's glad she's not mad at him.
Second Option: Leo is upset, loses -50 friendship but decides to ask her about it anyway. To which she reassures him that she's not mad at him, just that she thought he liked Jas better and decided to be more like her.

Eloise goes to Leo for advice. Richie doesn't seem very well, but her dad can find nothing physically wrong with him, and she's worried that something is very wrong with him. Perhaps he'll tell Leo? Leo talks to Richie and learns that Richie is feeling lonely. She doesn't spend as much time with him anymore, and he's bored.

******************
Aideen
******************

2 hearts
Aideen is first seen talking to her cat. Bemoaning the fact that she wishes life were like one of her books, that a handsome and sophisticated man might come sauntering through her door and sweep her off her feet.
Enter the farmer.
Aideen is embarrassed, hopes that they have not heard her pouring out her soul to her cat, and covers it by saying she has listed the spare rooms on some sort of stardew equivalent of Air B n B. But alas, no one has yet taken her up on the offer. 
Farmer can offer some advice:
- It’s early days yet.
	“Oh my, the glass is certainly half full for you, isn’t it? Still, a little optimism will certainly be advantageous for %farm, I do not doubt.
- This is hardly a vacation spot.
 	“Oh, aren’t you Mr/Mrs Cynical.#$b#You’re right, of course. Pelican Town is hardly Paradise Bay.#$b#Yet the peace might be an attraction in itself, don’t you think?
Carry On. 


- Maybe you’re being too picky.
	“Picky?$a#$b#It is no shame, nor crime, to be discerning.#$b#Indeed, it would be most disadvantageous to invite an unruly guest into my house.#$b#On that note, perhaps it is time you should leave, for surely that farm must require your attention.
- I hear you’re looking for a suitor.
	“Oh! The gall of you! To listen in on a lady’s private conversation.#$b#Perhaps you should take your nose and poke it into someone else’s business!$a
End

Could then follow with a series of vinagrettes where Aideen interviews different custom NPCs or townsfolk and dismisses them. 

4 hearts:
you receive a letter. Aideen is flustered! She’s had an order for a very special bouquet and her delivery never arrived. She requires you to bring to her house her immediately, four flowers:
Crocus, poppy, fairy rose, sweet pea
It is highly unlikely farmer will be able to immediately comply with this request.
But where they do, she is very apologetic at wasting their time – because her delivery has arrived! By way of apology, she teaches the farmer how to make the mystical bouquet and gives them one, suggesting that they gift it to their sweetheart.
* perhaps two events: one within 3 days of receiving the request, the other after that, when she berates them for being too long about it, but still thanks them profusely.

** Add a unique gift response for if you give her the bouquet.
 

Summer 6 hearts:
Aideen is upset - the night was too stuffy and she left the windows open, and Munchie must have got out! She cannot find him anywhere. Farmer offers to keep an eye out for him.
Farmer exits the house and finds Munchie, hidden beneath a bush. He's scared and a little scratched up. They take him back to Aideen. She smothers him with affection, thanks the farmer, and determines to take the cat to the vet.

Aideen comes running up to the farmer:
speak Aideen \"@! You have not, perchance, seen Baron Munchington, have you?\"/
emote farmer ?
speak Aideen \"It was most frightfully stuffy last night, so I left the window open. He must've escaped in the night!#$b#But he did not return home for his breakfast. And the Baron never misses breakfast. Never!#$b#
Oh no! What if those dreadful crabs got him!#$b#\"
question fork0 \"Please, will you help me look for him?#Of course!#No, find your own cat.

Afterwards she praises Jacob for his attentivess and desire to listen and not treat her like a crazy cat lady.

8 hearts (must have seen 6 heart event)

Farmer walks in just as Aideen gets off the phone. Aideen is noticeably upset. When probed, she confesses that her ex-boyfriend has got in contact with her, and he is now afianced and wishes for her to provide flowers for their wedding.

Farmer can try and console her, but she brushes it away:
"It is of little consequence, I was young, more in love with the thought of being in love, than I was actually fond of him. No, he has found a much better match now, and I shall be delighted to decorate his wedding. 
It is only... well...
*turns away, melanchololic music begins to play*
"It is silly... but I had thought, by now, that I would have found my One True Love."
*turns back* 
"I do not ask for much, do I just? I just wish for someone sophisticated with a sense of refinement. Someone who is kind, and can engage in lively dialogue." 
$q
#1. Perhaps your True Love is living right next door?
#2. Have you considered letting a humble farmer sweep you off your feet?
#3. Who needs love when you have cats?
#4. Love? Love is a lie.


“Next door? Oh, surely not Tristan, for all that I have a certain affection for him; he is barely civilized.#$b#Or do you mean Dr Jacob? Hmm... well, he is certainly kind and we have, on occasion, engaged in a rousing discussions of literature and the arts.#$b#Also, Baron Munchington is certainly fond of him. But I fear he would regard me as a mere shadow of his wife.”
(When: {"HasSeenEvent":"5295001" , "spouse:MisterGinger":"false"}

“Next door? Oh, surely not Sterling, he may exude a certain boyish charm, but no, he is barely civilized!#$b#Or do you mean Dr Jacob? Hmm... well, he is certainly kind and we have, on occasion, engaged in a rousing discussions of literature and the arts.#$b#Also, Baron Munchington is certainly fond of him. But I fear he would regard me as a mere shadow of his wife.”



Aideen confides in the farmer that she is starting to feel rather disinheartened in romance novels. For if they are to be believed, than surely her True Love would have entered her life by now. All she asks for is someone sophisticated, but kind; someone who can engage her in lively dialogue; and someone whom meets Munchie’s approval. 
Farmer can make some suggestions:
- Perhaps your True Love is living right next door?
	“Next door? Oh, surely not Tristan, for all that I have a certain affection for him; he is barely civilized.#$b#Or do you mean Dr Jacob? Hmm... well, he is certainly kind and we have, on occasion, engaged in a rousing discussions of literature and teh arts.#$b#Also, Baron Munchington is certainly fond of him. But I fear he would regard me as a mere shadow of his wife.”
- Have you considered letting a humble farmer sweep you off your feet?
	“Why, Mr @!^Why Ms @!#$b#Are you wishing to court me?#$b#You do exude a quaint rural charm.^I have never been courted by a lady before! This is most illuminating.#$b#And I have certainly grown fond of you. But love? Well, perhaps my tale is a slow burn, rather than a quick spark, yes?
- Pah, who needs love when you have cats?
	“Baron Munchington is certainly fine company, although he is not noted for his conversation.#$b#And I guess that I hoped I one day might have both.
- Romance novels are a lie - and so is love.
	“Such a nihilistic perspective, @. I am not sure I appreciate your cynicism. Please, take it elsewhere.


The plot can fork two ways here: farmer can give Aideen a bouquet and start dating her.

After X amount of days, if she is not dating the farmer, we will find someway to possibly spark the rival hearts event. This could go in two ways: Jacob could make a suggestion to farmer that he finds her quite delightful, and farmer could imply that Aideen is romantically attracted to him.

Alternately, Aideen herself could ask what farmer thinks of the situation.
